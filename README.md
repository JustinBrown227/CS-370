# CS-370
# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project implements a reinforcement learning algorithm in Python, specifically Q-learning, to train a neural network for navigating a maze. The provided code included several classes TreasureMaze, which represents a specific maze type; and GameExperience, which handles experience storage for the agent. My contributions involved utilizing these classes to implement the training logic. My work focused on creating and refining the training loop and ensuring efficient data handling in the experience replay mechanism. There are no explicit ethical concerns with this project.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design, analyze, and apply computational systems to solve problems across diverse fields. Their work is significant because it drives innovation, improves efficiency, and helps tackle challenges ranging from healthcare and climate change to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Computer Science intersects with almost every domain, making it a cornerstone of modern innovation and a field with limitless potential to shape the future.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I start by understanding and breaking it down into smaller parts while clarifying requirements and constraints. Abstract the key details, model the problem, and plan a step-by-step solution. Implement the solution incrementally, testing and debugging as I go, and refine it for performance and efficiency. Finally, I reflect on the process to improve your problem-solving skills for the future.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user include ensuring the safety, privacy, and accessibility of my systems. I should create products that are reliable, transparent, and free from harm while avoiding bias or discrimination. To the organization, my responsibilities involve maintaining integrity, honesty, and professionalism, ensuring my work aligns with organizational goals without compromising ethical principles. Balancing these responsibilities requires prioritizing the well-being of users while supporting organizational success in an ethical and responsible manner.
